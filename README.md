# Life 

## Everything that is Created or Starts must Inevitably End

This is one of the first lessons of life, that I personally have never explicitly been told.

Everything that ever enters your life, must leave one way or another.

You can choose the time and place of its leaving/destruction/end, or it'll just happen sometime, either:

- **before** or **after** (by who/whatever is left) you leave/die
- **quick** or slowly
- in your **conscious** awareness or **not**

These binaries must exist.

Look around you now. Look around inside your head about everything that matters to you.

Every last skerrick of this must all one day go.

My growing preferred option is: 

- *consciously*
- *before*
- (depends, but *my choice* of quick or slow)

As an act of love and kindness, I want to leave as little of my "stuff" as humanly possible for my loved ones to have to dea with when I die. There'll be some, of course, but hopefully it'll be straightforward.

It's probably the case that having this awareness is part of being a complete person.
