# Process Management

There is a balance between **technical** work and **process** work as both are critical for successful project delivery.

Too much emphasis on either will harm the project and the team. Yet there is an emphasis on having adequate *technical* capability and *process* awareness and capability is often an afterthought. There is often a disconnect between the individuals responsible for process and technical work. 

Thesis: Based on the deep and successful experience of games, there doesn't need to be a disconnect between *technical* work and *process* work. Further that individuals are feel more compelled while holding both in mind.
